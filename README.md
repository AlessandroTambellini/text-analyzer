# Text Analyzer

Simple app to get some metrics out of a text.

I programed this app few years ago and by looking at it now
I did not understand why there were so many files to build such a simple app.
So, I removed most of them. You can understand what I mean by looking at the
app after the first commit. 

## TODO

The graphical style is not great: if you want to have a bit of fun,
you could improve it.
- If the text is long, there is a lot of scrolling.
So, you may organize the metrics in columns or 
wrap the metric itself inside a box with an inner scrollbar
- The UI is bare bones, have fun customizing it!
